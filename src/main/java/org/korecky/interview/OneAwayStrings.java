	// They are one away from each other if a single operation (changing a character, deleting a character or adding a character) will change one of the strings to the other.
	// Examples:
	//   - "abcde" and "abcd" are one away (deleting a character).
	//   - "a" and "a" are one away (changing the only character 'a' to the equivalent character 'a').
	//   - "abc" and "bcc" are NOT one away. (They are two operations away.)
